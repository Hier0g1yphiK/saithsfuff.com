### Recommended Fix

Upgrade `next` from `14.2.35` → `15.5.16` (major version bump — expect breaking changes).

This resolves 13 of 14 Next.js issues. One medium-severity issue (CVE-2026-27980) requires `next@16.1.7`.

The `postcss` issue should resolve automatically when Next.js is upgraded (it pulls in a newer transitive version).

### Notes

- Next.js 14 → 15 is a **major upgrade** requiring migration work (React 19, changed APIs, etc.)
- Plan this as a dedicated effort rather than a quick patch
- No urgent action needed if the site is not handling sensitive user data or auth flows
